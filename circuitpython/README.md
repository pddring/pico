# Downloading the firmware
First you need to download the relevant UF2 file on to your pico so that it will run python code.
  
Find the relevant file from https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/ 

Hold down the bootsel button on the pico whilst plugging it into your computer. It should appear as a USB drive as RPI-RP2
Copy the UF2 file on to the RPI-RP2 drive. The drive will disappear when it's finished copying but that's OK.
